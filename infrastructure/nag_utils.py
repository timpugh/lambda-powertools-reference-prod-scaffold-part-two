"""Shared cdk-nag helpers.

``apply_compliance_aspects`` applies the full available rule-pack set to a
stack so every stack exercises the same compliance gauntlet, plus this
project's own ``TemplateConventionChecks`` validation Aspect (log-group
retention + explicit removal policy on stateful resources — see
``infrastructure.validation_aspects``). NIST 800-53 R4 is intentionally omitted —
R5 supersedes it and running both would duplicate findings on overlapping
controls.

``CDK_LAMBDA_SUPPRESSIONS`` is the canonical suppression list for CDK-managed
singleton Lambdas (AwsCustomResource provider, BucketDeployment, S3AutoDeleteObjects).
Their runtime, memory, tracing, DLQ, VPC, and IAM policies are all managed by
CDK and cannot be configured by the caller. Import it and pass it to
``NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions`` with ``apply_to_children=True``,
or use the ``suppress_cdk_singletons`` helper. Absolute-path suppression
(``add_resource_suppressions_by_path``) is intentionally avoided throughout this
project: the singletons are resolved via ``node.try_find_child`` so suppressions
keep working when the stacks are nested under a ``cdk.Stage`` (a path string
would break on the added Stage prefix).

    No rate-based rule is part of this shared set because edge and origin need

    aggregates by plain ``IP``: it inspects the *viewer* request, so the source
    IP it sees is already the real client's. On the regional ACL guarding the
    origin, *funnelled* traffic arrives from CloudFront edge IPs (plain-IP
    aggregation would pool many users behind a few shared edge IPs) — but
    *direct* ``execute-api`` callers, the bypass path the regional ACL exists

    the CloudTrail-logs bucket, and the WAF-logs bucket — share the same posture:
    block all public access, SSE-S3 (the S3/CloudTrail/WAF delivery services don't
    support KMS-CMK destination *buckets*), SSL enforced, no versioning, and a
    lifecycle that expires objects. Centralizing it keeps them in lockstep (and
    keeps pylint's R0801 from flagging three near-identical bucket blocks). What
    varies — name, ACL ownership, lifecycle length, removal policy, auto-delete —
    is passed in.

    Args:
        scope: Construct scope to create the bucket under.
        construct_id: The bucket's construct id.
        suppression_reason: The reason recorded on the log-bucket nag suppressions.
        expiration_days: Objects expire after this many days.
        removal_policy: DESTROY for the destroy-friendly default, RETAIN behind retain_data.
        auto_delete: Whether to empty the bucket on stack delete (must be False when RETAIN).
        bucket_name: Explicit name (only where AWS forces it, e.g. WAF's aws-waf-logs- prefix).
        object_ownership: Set BUCKET_OWNER_PREFERRED where ACL-based log delivery needs it.

    Returns:
        The created bucket.

def create_waf_logs_bucket(scope: Construct, suffix: str) -> s3.Bucket:
    """Create an ``aws-waf-logs-*`` S3 bucket wired for AWS WAF log delivery.

    AWS WAF requires the destination bucket name to start with ``aws-waf-logs-``
    (an AWS hard requirement — so this is a pinned name, unlike the auto-named
    buckets elsewhere). It's account-qualified for S3's global uniqueness plus a
    short hash of the stack name so multi-env / multi-region deployments in one
    account never collide on the name. Pinned-name caveat: a future
    replacement-forcing property change collides with the not-yet-deleted old
    bucket (CFN replacement is create-before-delete), so such a change must
    also change the name (e.g. the ``suffix``) in the same commit — see the
    AppConfig profile note in ``backend_app.py``.

    **The bucket policy must be complete before logging is enabled.** When WAF
    logging is turned on it ensures the ``delivery.logs.amazonaws.com`` write +
    ACL-check grant is on the bucket; if no policy exists yet WAF creates one,
    which then collides with CDK's own bucket policy (verified on a live deploy:
    ``The bucket policy already exists``). So this bucket *pre-declares* those
    exact delivery statements (plus the SSL-deny and the auto-delete grant) in
    its CDK-managed policy, and the caller orders the ``CfnLoggingConfiguration``
    *after* that policy (``logging.node.add_dependency(bucket.policy)``) — WAF
    then finds the grant already present and leaves the policy alone. ACLs are
    enabled (``BucketOwnerPreferred``) because WAF writes objects with a
    ``bucket-owner-full-control`` ACL.

    The caller points its ``CfnLoggingConfiguration.log_destination_configs`` at
    the returned bucket's ARN, adds the policy dependency above, and must call
    :func:`create_auto_delete_objects_log_group` once in the same stack (the
    bucket uses ``auto_delete_objects``). SSE-S3 (not CMK) because the WAF/Logs
    delivery service doesn't support KMS-CMK destination *buckets*.

    Args:
        scope: Any construct in the target stack (the bucket is created at the
            owning stack's level so the auto-delete-provider wiring can find it).
        suffix: Short discriminator for the bucket name (e.g. ``cf`` / ``api``).
