# templates (no f-string) with a __WAF_TABLE__ sentinel substituted per table via
# str.replace — the table names are hardcoded literals, so there's no injection
# surface; the static-template form also keeps the SQL-construction linter quiet.
#
# Every query filters on the log_time partition key (last 30 days, rendered in
# the projection's yyyy/MM/dd format — Athena prunes projected partitions only
# when the predicate string matches that format exactly). This is the query
# half of the partition-projection contract with _create_waf_glue_table: the
# filter is what turns projection into pruning, and per the Athena docs a
# condition in any OTHER date format (dashes, DATE literals) silently disables
# it. Keep the predicate and the table's projection.log_time.format in lockstep.

        # This is the permanent fix for aws/aws-cdk#15891, replacing the

        #
        # CallerReference is gated on the BucketDeployment's content-hashed S3
        # object key. Same assets → same key → CFN sees no change → no invalidation
        # fires (correct: nothing to invalidate). Different assets → different key →
        # CFN fires on_update → invalidation runs. Prevents backend-only deploys from
        # burning the 1000/month free invalidation quota. See README "Design
        # decisions" for the longer write-up.
        #
        # NOTE: CloudFront caps CallerReference at 128 characters, so we cannot fold
        # identifiers (e.g. RUM monitor/identity pool ids) into it — the content-hashed
        # object key alone is already ~68 chars. A deploy that changes config.json's
        # contents (apiUrl is now a fixed literal and never varies) is still covered:
        # its Source.json_data hash — and thus this object key — changes with it.
        #
        # Rollback caveat (accepted): CloudFront treats a repeated CallerReference
        # as an idempotent replay of the earlier invalidation, so rolling assets
        # back to a previously deployed content hash reuses that deploy's
        # CallerReference and NO new invalidation runs — viewers keep the
        # rolled-back-FROM version cached until TTL expiry. A deploy-unique nonce
        # would fix that but would also invalidate on every backend-only deploy,
        # defeating the quota-saving design. After an asset rollback, run a manual
        # invalidation (CloudFrontDistributionId output) if freshness matters.

        shared ``*.cloudfront.net`` host cannot (and should not) be submitted. A
        fork that wires a custom domain (see TODO "Enforce TLS 1.2+ minimum")
        should flip preload=True once ready to commit the domain to the list.

        CSP: the reference page ships inline ``<script>`` and ``<style>`` blocks
        (the RUM bootstrap in ``<head>`` shares ``window.__appConfigPromise`` with
        the body handler, relying on synchronous head execution), so
        ``'unsafe-inline'`` is required on script-src/style-src or the page's own
        scripts would be blocked. Everything else is locked down:
        default-src/object-src/base-uri/frame-ancestors are constrained, and
        script-src/connect-src are scoped to the exact AWS endpoints the page talks
        to (RUM client script + data plane, Cognito Identity for guest credentials).
        The API call is same-origin (routed through the /api/* behavior), so
        connect-src no longer needs an execute-api entry at all. To reach a
        strict (nonce/hash) CSP without ``'unsafe-inline'``, externalize the two
        inline scripts into ``'self'``-served .js assets first — CloudFront cannot
        mint per-response nonces, and static hashes would break on any edit.
        Tracked in TODO "CSP header on the static page".

        The RUM client script URL is hardcoded to us-east-1 in frontend/index.html
        regardless of deploy region, so script-src pins us-east-1 specifically
        while connect-src follows ``self.region`` for the data plane and Cognito.

        - Each definition needs an explicit ``EventPattern``; the API rejects vended-metric
          submissions with just ``Name`` + ``DimensionKeys`` (returns 200 OK with an Errors[]
          body that AwsCustomResource treats as success).
        - All three ``rum:*`` actions are bundled on the destination CR's policy so the
          BatchCreate call benefits from a full putRumMetricsDestination round-trip of IAM
          propagation lead time. Splitting them per-CR loses the IAM race ~100% of the time.
        - ``on_update`` mirrors ``on_create``; without it AwsCustomResource no-ops on
          CloudFormation UPDATE events and changes to the metric list never reach AWS.
        - Http5xx omits the explicit numeric range filter that Http4xx requires (RUM applies
          the 5xx filter internally for that vended metric).

        ``location`` is the ``s3://…/{web-acl-name}/`` prefix (computed by the
        Stage). Partition projection on a single ``log_time`` partition means
        Athena resolves partitions in-memory — no crawler, no ``ALTER TABLE ADD
        PARTITION``. Schema follows AWS's documented WAF Athena DDL; the openx
        JSON SerDe maps WAF's camelCase keys to the lowercase columns
        case-insensitively.

        **Projection granularity is DAY, range NOW-90DAYS (don't widen either
        casually).** WAF's key layout is ``…/{acl}/yyyy/MM/dd/HH/mm/``, but a
        day-level partition prefix still matches the deeper hour/minute keys —
        S3 listing is prefix-based — and AWS's documented WAF projection DDL
        partitions by day for exactly this reason. Athena issues an S3 LIST per
        projected partition a query's pruning leaves in scope, so granularity x
        range is the real cost/latency knob: an earlier minute-granularity
        config anchored at a fixed 2025 date projected ~800k partitions, and a
        single unfiltered named query ran for 6+ minutes issuing an S3 LIST per
        partition (found live). Day x the bucket's own 90-day lifecycle = at
        most ~90 partitions, so even an unfiltered query stays fast — and the
        relative NOW-90DAYS start never projects dates the lifecycle has
        already expired. The named queries additionally filter on log_time
        (see _WAF_NAMED_QUERIES) in the projection's exact date format, which
        is what Athena requires for pruning.
