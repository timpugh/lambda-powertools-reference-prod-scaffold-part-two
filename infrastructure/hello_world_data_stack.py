"""HelloWorldDataStack — the stateful data layer (DynamoDB + its own CMK).

Isolated from the compute/backend stack on purpose, per the CDK best practice
"keep stateful resources in their own stack." The payoff is lifecycle
independence: a fork can destroy and recreate the stateless compute stack
freely without risking the data, and can switch on retention with one flag.

**Why this exists in a template that ships destroy-friendly.** Stack topology
is the expensive-to-retrofit decision; ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`` is a one-line
flag. So the *structure* (this dedicated stack) is baked in now, and the only
thing a production fork must change is ``retain_data=True`` — at which point
the table and its key flip to ``RETAIN``, DynamoDB deletion protection turns
on, and the stack gets termination protection. The default is ``False`` so
development and ephemeral environments tear down cleanly.

**Dedicated CMK (not the compute stack's key).** The table is encrypted with
*this* stack's key. Keeping the key with the data it protects is what makes
retention meaningful — a retained table whose key lived in a destroyable
compute stack would be unreadable after that stack is torn down. It also keeps
the cross-stack surface to a single relationship (the Lambda's grant on the
table), avoids sharing a key across the stack boundary, and gives each key a
tighter, least-privilege key policy.
