"""HelloWorldApp construct — the domain-level application.

Encapsulates all resources that make up the Hello World serverless application:
KMS key, DynamoDB idempotency table, SSM greeting parameter, AppConfig feature
flags, Lambda function, API Gateway, Application Insights monitoring, dashboard,
Logs Insights saved queries, and per-resource cdk-nag suppressions.

Following the CDK best practice "model with constructs, deploy with stacks":
the Stack only composes this construct, applies stack-wide Aspects, and wires
outputs. Any deployment shape (multiple copies in one stack, multi-tenant,
dev-next-to-prod) can be achieved by instantiating this construct multiple
times without subclassing the Stack.

                This construct wires it into the Lambda (the

                grant) but does not own its lifecycle — see that stack for the

            is_production_env: When True (the default, and what the default
                ``prod`` deployment environment passes), alarm notifications
                are routed to a CMK-encrypted SNS topic. Non-production
                environments — ephemeral per-developer/per-branch stacks in
                particular — still get the full dashboard and alarm set, but
                without the SNS topic so short-lived stacks never page anyone.
            appconfig_monitor: Opt-in production switch for AppConfig feature-flag
                rollouts. When True, the flag deployment uses a gradual strategy
                (LINEAR 25%/step over 10 min, 5-min bake) and the environment
                carries a CloudWatch alarm monitor that auto-rolls-back a bad flag
                config (``_attach_appconfig_rollback_monitor``). Defaults to False
                — all-at-once, no monitor — because a monitored CFN-managed
                deployment **cannot create a cold stack** (the monitor alarm starts
                ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA``, which AppConfig treats as a rollback signal).
                Enable it only AFTER a first all-at-once deploy has produced metric

        # (FeatureFlagEvaluationFailure, emitted only by the running Lambda) has

        # aborts the initial deploy (verified on a live deploy). The metric is

        in the ``HelloWorldApiOutput`` CfnOutput — bypasses CloudFront entirely,
        so without a second ACL here a caller hitting that URL directly evades
        every managed rule group. This REGIONAL ACL mirrors the four managed
        threat rule groups onto the origin so both paths get the same protection.

        Scope must be ``REGIONAL`` and the ACL must live in the API's own region
        (which is why it's here, in the backend stack, not in the us-east-1-pinned

        deliberately omitted — every request reaching the origin comes from a
        CloudFront edge IP, so an IP-aggregated limit would penalise legitimate
        funnelled traffic; origin volume is bounded by the stage's
        throttling_rate_limit/throttling_burst_limit and the function's
        reserved_concurrent_executions instead.

        This is defence in depth, not a replacement for the documented fixes:

        Only called when the ``appconfig_monitor`` switch is set — it is an opt-in
        production add-on, NOT part of the default template. AppConfig watches the
        alarm during a flag rollout (and its bake window); if the alarm enters
        ALARM, AppConfig rolls the configuration back to the previous version
        automatically. This pairs with the gradual deployment strategy selected in
        ``__init__`` under the same switch — the gradual rollout buys the window in
        which the monitor can act before a bad flag reaches every caller.

        **Cold-deploy constraint (why this is opt-in).** AppConfig rolls back when
        the monitored alarm is in ALARM **or INSUFFICIENT_DATA**. A freshly created
        alarm starts in INSUFFICIENT_DATA until CloudWatch's first evaluation, and
        the ``FeatureFlagEvaluationFailure`` metric below has no datapoints at all on
        a brand-new stack — so a monitored deployment that runs during *initial*
        stack creation gets rolled back and the stack never reaches CREATE_COMPLETE
        (verified on a live deploy, even with ``NOT_BREACHING`` set). Enable
        ``appconfig_monitor`` only AFTER a first all-at-once deploy has produced
        metric data; see README "Deployment safety".

        The monitored signal is the handler's ``FeatureFlagEvaluationFailure``
        metric, NOT Lambda errors. A bad flag config is caught and degraded
        gracefully (the request still returns 200 with the default flag value),
        so it produces no Lambda error or 5xx — the custom metric is the only
        signal a config is broken. AppConfig reads the alarm state through
        ``alarm_role_arn``.

        Watching a metric addressed purely by name + static dimensions (rather
        than ``self.function.metric_errors()``) is also what keeps this wiring
        acyclic: the environment references this alarm (monitors), so the alarm
        must not transitively reference the function — which depends on the
