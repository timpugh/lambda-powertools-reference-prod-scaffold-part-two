"""AppStage — groups the data, WAF, backend, frontend, and audit stacks as one deploy unit.

The five stacks are always deployed together for a given region, so modelling
them as a :class:`cdk.Stage` makes that relationship structural rather than
conventional. A Stage also scopes the synthesised cloud assembly under its
own subdirectory (``cdk.out/assembly-{stage}/``), which keeps multi-region
synths from mixing their templates in the root of ``cdk.out/``.

Two stacks hold the stateful resources, kept separate from the stateless
compute so their lifecycles are independent: the **data** stack (the DynamoDB
idempotency table + its CMK — see :mod:`infrastructure.data_stack`) and
the **audit** stack (the CloudTrail data-event trail + its log bucket + a CMK —
see :mod:`infrastructure.audit_stack`). The audit stack is created last
because it *audits* the frontend buckets (a one-way dependency).

This change also paves the way for CDK Pipelines (each Stage is the natural
deployment unit) and for a future multi-environment layout (dev/staging/prod
as separate Stage instances under the same App).

Stack names are set explicitly via ``stack_name=`` so the CloudFormation
names stay unchanged (``ServerlessAppBackend-{region}`` etc.). Without the override,
wrapping in a Stage would prefix each stack name with the Stage ID, which
would orphan any currently deployed stacks.

Environment dimension
---------------------
``env_name`` adds a deployment-environment axis on top of the region axis.
The default, ``prod``, keeps the legacy stack names byte-for-byte so existing
deployments are not orphaned. Any other value is inserted into every stack
name (``ServerlessAppBackend-{env_name}-{region}``), which makes deployments
collision-free per environment — including *ephemeral* per-developer or
per-branch environments (``-c env=alice-feature-x``), where two people
iterating in one account must never fight over the same CloudFormation
stacks. Only the ``prod`` environment routes alarm notifications to the SNS
topic; ephemeral stacks keep dashboards and alarms but page nobody.

    """All five stacks (data, WAF, backend, frontend, audit) for a single regional deployment.

    The WAF stack is always pinned to ``us-east-1`` (CloudFront-scoped WebACLs
    must live there). The data, backend, frontend, and audit stacks deploy to
    ``region``. When ``region`` differs from ``us-east-1``,
    ``cross_region_references=True`` on the frontend stack bridges the WAF ARN
    through SSM automatically.

    ``env_name`` selects the deployment environment (see module docstring):
    ``prod`` (default) keeps the legacy stack names and routes alarms to SNS;
    anything else gets env-suffixed, collision-free stack names with alarm
    paging disabled.

    ``retain_data`` is the production switch for the stateful data stack: when
    ``True`` the idempotency table and its CMK flip to ``RemovalPolicy.RETAIN``
    with DynamoDB deletion protection and stack termination protection. It
    defaults to ``False`` so the template (and ephemeral environments) tear
    down cleanly; production forks set it via ``-c retain_data=true``.

    ``appconfig_monitor`` is the opt-in production switch for AppConfig feature-
    flag rollouts: when ``True`` the flag deployment uses a gradual strategy and
    the environment carries a CloudWatch alarm monitor that auto-rolls-back a bad
    flag config. It defaults to ``False`` (all-at-once, no monitor) because a
    monitored CFN-managed deployment cannot create a cold stack — see
    :meth:`BackendApp._attach_appconfig_rollback_monitor`. Set it via
    ``-c appconfig_monitor=true`` only AFTER a first all-at-once deploy.

    ``ssm_param_path`` optionally overrides the auto-generated name of the
    greeting SSM parameter. ``None`` (the default) leaves CDK's auto-naming
    untouched — the Lambda reads whichever name is live via the
    ``GREETING_PARAM_NAME`` env var either way, so this is purely cosmetic
    unless a fork wants the parameter at a specific, predictable path. Set it
    via ``-c ssm_param_path=/org/app/greeting`` before the first deploy:
