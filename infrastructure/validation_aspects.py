"""Synth-time validation Aspects enforcing this template's own conventions.

These complement cdk-nag rather than duplicate it. cdk-nag enforces broad
security/compliance posture across five rule packs; these Aspects enforce two
project-specific invariants that no rule pack covers and that are easy to
violate by accident when adding resources:

1. **Every CloudWatch log group declares an explicit retention.** The
   CloudWatch Logs default is "never expire", which is both a cost leak
   (logs accumulate forever) and a compliance footgun (no defined audit
   window). This repo sets ``retention=`` on every log group; the Aspect turns
   "forgot to set retention" into a synth error instead of a silently
   unbounded log group.

2. **Every stateful resource declares an explicit removal policy.** L2
   constructs fill in a default (usually ``RETAIN``), but a raw L1 resource
   (``CfnBucket`` / ``CfnTable`` / ``CfnGlobalTable`` / ``CfnKey``) added
   directly carries no ``DeletionPolicy`` at all — which in a template that
   advertises clean teardown silently strands resources on ``cdk destroy``.
   The Aspect requires the lifecycle choice to be explicit on stateful L1s.

Violations are emitted as error-level annotations, so they fail ``cdk synth``
(the authoritative gate) and are asserted absent by the ``tests/cdk``
nag-annotation checks — the same surface cdk-nag findings surface on. The
Aspect is wired for every stack by :func:`infrastructure.nag_utils.apply_compliance_aspects`,
so it runs in lockstep with the rule packs.
