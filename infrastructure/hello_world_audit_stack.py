"""HelloWorldAuditStack — the audit-trail data store (CloudTrail + its bucket + CMK).

Holds the stateful, compliance-relevant audit data — the CloudTrail object-level
S3 data-event trail, the S3 bucket its log files land in, and a dedicated CMK —
separate from the stateless frontend that *produces* the events. This mirrors the
data-stack pattern: the *trail + bucket + key* is the stateful unit and lives
here; the buckets it merely **audits** (the frontend asset + access-log buckets)
stay in the frontend stack and are referenced one-way (this stack depends on the
frontend; the frontend never depends on this one).

**Why the trail lives with its bucket, not with the producers.** A CloudTrail
trail and its log bucket are inseparable — the bucket policy references the
trail's ARN. Splitting them across stacks creates a dependency cycle with the
frontend. Keeping the pair here, auditing the frontend buckets via a one-way
import, is the only cycle-free boundary that doesn't require pinning bucket
names (which would forfeit replacement-safety — see CLAUDE.md).

**Dedicated CMK.** The trail's log files are encrypted with *this* stack's key,
not the frontend's — so retaining audit logs in production retains the audit key,
not the frontend key (which also encrypts the destroy-friendly asset bucket).

**retain_data.** Default ``False`` keeps the bucket and CMK ``DESTROY`` (clean
teardown). ``True`` flips both to ``RETAIN`` and turns on stack termination
protection — the production posture for long-lived audit data. (A 90-day S3
lifecycle bounds storage either way; a compliance fork extends it and adds AWS
Backup / Object Lock — see TODO.md.)
