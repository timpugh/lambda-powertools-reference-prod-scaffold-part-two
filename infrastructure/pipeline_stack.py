"""PipelineStack — the self-mutating CD pipeline (CDK Pipelines).

Synthesized ONLY in pipeline mode (``-c pipeline=true`` — see app.py); the
default shape keeps the direct-AppStage layout for manual `make deploy` and
ephemeral ENV deploys. Sourced from GitHub ``main`` via a CodeConnections
connection (one-time console handshake; the ARN arrives via the
``code_connection_arn`` context key, validated fail-loud in app_stage).

Stage ladder (spec 2026-07-10-ci-cd-pipeline-design): a persistent ``dev``
environment (pipeline-reserved env name), live integration tests against it,
a manual approval, then prod — which reuses the legacy stack names, so the
pipeline updates the existing prod stacks in place.

Encryption posture: per-stack CMK (matches every other stack), encrypting
the artifact bucket and the CodeBuild log group. The log group is CFN-owned
and handed to every generated CodeBuild project — CodeBuild otherwise
auto-creates never-expire log groups outside CloudFormation (the
dangling-resource problem this repo's cleanup patterns exist for).

        Every ``applies_to`` id below was read verbatim from a real gate run
        (``tests/cdk/test_pipeline_stack.py::TestPipelineNagCompliance`` — cdk-nag
        v3 matches IAM4/IAM5 findings by their exact granular ``Rule[Finding]``
        id, so a bare rule-id acknowledgment matches nothing; see CLAUDE.md).
        Region/account are interpolated from this stack's own ``self.region`` /
        ``self.account`` rather than hardcoded: CDK Pipelines requires a
        concrete environment (see the ``PipelineStack`` construction site), so
        these are never unresolved tokens here, and the acknowledgment stays
        correct once a real account replaces the test fixture's dummy one.

        Two forward-looking fragility caveats baked into these literals:

        1. The CDK-generated logical-id hash suffixes embedded in a few
           CodeBuild log-group/report-group ARNs (e.g.
           ``<CdBuildSynthCdkBuildProjectEB9D3AEF>``) are pasted as printed —
           they're derived from the construct tree, not from account/region,
           so they're stable across account/region but NOT across a
           reshaping of this stack's construct tree (renaming/reordering the
           pipeline's stages or CodeBuild steps regenerates the hash and
           silently un-acknowledges these findings).
        2. Every ``<AWS::Partition>`` entry is paired with its literal-``aws``
           sibling via ``_with_literal_partition`` below. The in-process test
           gate (``TestPipelineNagCompliance``, and every other cdk-nag test
           fixture in this repo) synthesizes without cdk.json context, so
           cdk-nag renders the unresolved partition pseudo-parameter as the
           ``<AWS::Partition>`` placeholder. The pipeline's own Synth step —
           and any CLI synth — runs with cdk.json's
           ``@aws-cdk/core:enablePartitionLiterals: true`` +
           ``target-partitions: ["aws"]``, which resolves the same ARNs to a
           literal ``arn:aws:...`` instead, a different exact finding id the
           placeholder-only acknowledgment would NOT match — surfacing these
           findings as unacknowledged and failing
           ``scripts/check_validation_report.py`` on the pipeline's very
           first live run. Carrying both renderings keeps the CLI gate and
           the test gate in lockstep; whichever rendering a given synth
           doesn't produce simply matches nothing and suppresses nothing, so
           it's harmless in both gates (see ``frontend_stack.py``'s RUM
           cleanup / BucketDeployment acknowledgments for the same pattern).
