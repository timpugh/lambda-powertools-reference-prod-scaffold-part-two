# CDK and Lambda Powertools require incompatible `attrs` versions (CDK pulls
# attrs<26 via jsii; Powertools pulls attrs>=26). uv locks both resolutions
# in a single uv.lock via `[tool.uv.conflicts]`, but each resolution must
# install into its own venv.
#
# Both venvs live at the PROJECT ROOT (relative paths, gitignored):
#
#   .venv         — CDK workstation: cdk + test + lint + docs groups
#   .venv-lambda  — Lambda runtime:  lambda + test + lint groups (unit tests, OpenAPI gen)
#
# Both are created automatically by `make install` (which runs `uv sync` for
# each group set into the right env). You do not pick the location — uv does,
# based on the directory `make` is invoked from. Each clone of this repo gets
# its own pair; nothing is shared across projects on disk.
#
# Check status with `make doctor`. Nuke and rebuild with `make clean-venvs &&
# make install`.
#
# The venv selector uses the UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT env var that uv honours
# natively — no activation dance, no symlink juggling.

# CDK CLI comes from package.json via npx (installed by `npm ci` in `make

# the one un-pinned supply-chain input in an otherwise fully-locked repo, and
# let local and CI versions drift apart. Dependabot's npm ecosystem tracks the
# pin in package.json like every Python dependency.

# --locked mirrors CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml). Without it, a stale uv.lock
# would silently install whatever the resolver picks today, which can drift

# The lint group rides into .venv-lambda alongside the runtime so `make
# typecheck` can run mypy in this env over lambda/ and scripts/ (where
# Powertools is importable but aws-cdk-lib is not). Without lint here,
# mypy is missing entirely and the typecheck target falls back to the
# weaker .venv-side check that treats Powertools as Any.

test-integration: ## Run integration tests against a deployed stack (uses .venv-lambda)
	# --override-ini drops the project-wide --cov-fail-under=100 gate (which
	# only makes sense for unit tests over lambda/) so integration tests don't
	# fail the run on coverage instead of behavior. Mirrors test-cdk's pattern.
	# --timeout=120 lifts the 30s per-test cap from pyproject (an ini option,
	# NOT part of addopts, so the override above does not touch it): the
	# warm-latency test makes 4 sequential HTTP calls with 10s client timeouts
	# and can exceed 30s on a degraded network without anything being wrong.

# Combined coverage across BOTH venvs in one report. The editor's Test panel
# can't produce a single cross-venv number on its own — each "Run with
# Coverage" loads one .coverage data file, and the multi-root global run's
# per-folder line highlighting is subject to an upstream bug
# (microsoft/vscode-python#25643). This target sidesteps both: it runs the CDK
# suite under .venv and the unit suite under .venv-lambda, each appending into
# ONE shared .coverage (--cov-append, no erase between runs), then renders a
# single HTML report spanning hello_world/ (covered by the CDK tests) and
# lambda/ (covered by the unit tests). --override-ini=addopts= drops the global
# unit-only flags (--cov=lambda, the 100% gate, -n auto) so this run sets its
# own --cov targets and is NOT gated — the combined total is informational
# (hello_world/ carries intentional uncovered defensive lines), while the 100%
# lambda/ gate stays enforced by `make test` and CI. Integration tests are
# excluded: they need a live stack. coverage is invoked via `python -m` so it
# resolves from each venv's pytest-cov install without relying on a console
# script on PATH.

cdk-synth: ## Synthesize all CDK stacks and validate cdk-nag rules (CDK CLI via `npm ci` / `make install`)
	# The '**' glob descends into Stage-nested stacks. Without it, `cdk synth`
	# stops at the Stage manifest, the three nested stacks never synthesize,
	# and cdk-nag rules silently don't fire on them — so a "passing" synth
	# can mask findings that surface later in `cdk deploy`.
	$(CDK) synth '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-notices: ## Show AWS-published CDK notices (CVEs, deprecated CDK versions, upcoming breaking changes)
	$(CDK) notices

cdk-deprecations: ## List every deprecated CDK API used by any stack (synth output filtered for "deprecated")
	$(CDK) synth '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG) 2>&1 | grep -i deprecat || echo "No deprecated CDK APIs in use"

cdk-ls: ## List all CDK stacks (uses '**' to descend into Stage-nested stacks)
	# Without '**', `cdk ls` stops at the top-level Stage manifest and
	# prints nothing useful. With it, the three nested stacks (Backend,
	# WAF, Frontend) are listed — handy as a sanity check after stack-graph
	# refactors or when verifying the Stage wiring is intact.
	$(CDK) ls '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-diff: ## Preview infra changes against deployed stacks (requires AWS credentials)
	# Same Stage-nesting trap as cdk-synth and deploy: bare `cdk diff`
	# walks only the App's direct children and reports no changes for the
	# three real stacks. Use this as the pre-PR companion to cdk-synth —
	# synth tells you cdk-nag is happy, diff tells you what would deploy.
	$(CDK) diff '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-drift: ## Detect drift between deployed resources and what CDK last shipped (requires AWS credentials)
	# Surfaces resources mutated outside CDK — console edits, manual SDK
	# calls, neighbor-stack collisions. Load-bearing for this template's
	# encryption posture: CMK key policies, IAM grants, and CloudTrail
	# trail config are easy to silently drift and easy to miss.
	$(CDK) drift '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-revert-drift: ## Deploy AND auto-revert out-of-band drift back to code (requires CDK CLI 2.1110.0+)
	# The remediation half of cdk-drift: where `cdk drift` only reports
	# resources mutated outside CDK, --revert-drift rolls them back to what
	# the code last shipped — in the same operation as any pending template
	# changes (CloudFormation's REVERT_DRIFT deployment mode). Self-healing
	# posture for this template's encryption invariants: a console-edited CMK
	# key policy or IAM grant snaps back to the committed state on deploy.
	#
	# Deliberately a separate, opt-in target rather than folded into `deploy`:
	# --revert-drift assumes code is always the source of truth, so it would
	# also undo a legitimate emergency console change made during an incident.
	# Keep the default `deploy` predictable; reach for this consciously after
	# `make cdk-drift` shows what would be reverted.
	$(CDK) deploy '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG) --revert-drift --require-approval never

cdk-diagnose: ## Root-cause CloudFormation failures with construct paths and source locations (CDK 2.1120.0+)
	# The --unstable=diagnose flag gates the command while it's behind the
	# unstable feature flag; drop the flag once it graduates to stable.
	# Output maps CFN errors back to the construct and the file:line where
	# it was defined — designed to be parseable by AI agents as well as
	# humans. Substitute a specific stack name for '**' to narrow scope.
	$(CDK) --unstable=diagnose diagnose '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-gc: ## Inspect (dry-run) unused Lambda/Docker assets in the CDK bootstrap S3/ECR repos
	# Every `cdk deploy` adds new Lambda zips and container images to the
	# CDKToolkit bootstrap bucket and ECR repo, but older revisions
	# accumulate forever. --action=print is dry-run only — it tags isolated
	# assets and reports what *would* be deleted on a subsequent run, but
	# deletes nothing. To actually GC, run `npx cdk --unstable=gc gc` directly:
	# the default (--action=full, --confirm=true) prompts interactively
	# before each deletion. --created-buffer-days=1 (default) skips assets
	# younger than a day; tune via --created-buffer-days=N for tighter
	# windows. The --unstable=gc flag gates the command while gc is behind
	# the unstable feature flag; drop it once gc graduates to stable.
	$(CDK) --unstable=gc gc --action=print

cdk-rollback: ## Roll deployed stacks back to their last stable state (use after a partial deploy failure)
	# Pairs with cdk-diagnose: when a deploy half-fails and CloudFormation
	# parks a stack in UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED, this returns it to the
	# last good state without manual console intervention. Same '**' trap
	# as cdk-synth and friends — bare `cdk rollback` only sees the empty
	# Stage manifest.
	$(CDK) rollback '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

# The '**' glob is required so CDK descends into the Stage-nested stacks —
# without it `cdk deploy` only sees the empty Stage manifest and exits with
# "No stack found in the main cloud assembly". --require-approval never
# skips the interactive IAM-change prompt; cdk-nag has already gated the
# change at synth time. Drop the flag for a manual review of every IAM diff.
deploy: ## Deploy all stacks to us-east-1 (ENV=<name> for an ephemeral env, -c region=X for other regions)
	$(CDK) deploy '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG) --require-approval never

# --force skips the interactive "are you sure?" prompt, mirroring how
# the deploy target uses --require-approval never. Without --force, the
# command fails outright in non-TTY contexts (CI, background shells)
# with "terminal is not attached so we are unable to get a confirmation".
# If you want the confirmation back for a one-off run, invoke cdk
# directly: `npx cdk destroy '**'`. Three stacks are destroyed independently
# — frontend first (consumes the WAF ARN), then backend and WAF.
destroy: ## Destroy all stacks in us-east-1 (ENV=<name> for an ephemeral env, -c region=X for other regions)
	$(CDK) destroy '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG) --force

# Region the frontend stack (and its log buckets) live in. Override to match a

# Resolve every S3 bucket in the frontend stack by type (names are CDK-generated,

# CloudWatch log delivery is asynchronous in the same way: the custom-resource
# provider and BucketDeployment Lambdas flush their final teardown logs AFTER
# CloudFormation deleted their (CMK-encrypted) log groups, and the Lambda service
# re-creates the configured group on delivery — leaving unencrypted,
# retention-less groups dangling after an otherwise-clean destroy (observed on a
# live teardown). Prefixes are scoped to the FULL stack names of the deployment
# being torn down — "HelloWorld$(ENVSEG)-$(REGION)" etc. for stack-named groups,
# "/aws/lambda/<stack-name>" for function groups, and "aws-waf-logs-<stack-name>"
# for WAF groups. The env segment in the prefix is what keeps multi-environment
# accounts safe: a bare "HelloWorld" prefix would also sweep the log groups of
# every OTHER deployment environment still running in the account.
# WAF-stack-derived groups are swept in us-east-1 too because the WAF stack
# always lives there regardless of REGION. Idempotent; missing groups are no-ops.
#
# KNOWN GAP these prefixes cannot close (handled by the snapshot pass below):
# CloudFormation composes Lambda physical names as {stack-name}-{logical-id}-
# {suffix} truncated to 64 chars, and the truncation cuts the STACK-NAME
# PORTION mid-word — a live teardown left
# "/aws/lambda/HelloWorldFrontend-us-eas-CustomS3AutoDeleteObject-…" behind
# ("us-eas", not "us-east-1"), which no full-stack-name prefix can match.

# CloudFront / S3 / CloudTrail log delivery is ASYNCHRONOUS, so a log file can land
# in the access-log (or CloudTrail) bucket AFTER cdk's auto_delete_objects empties
# it during teardown — leaving DeleteBucket with a 409 "bucket not empty" and the
# stack in DELETE_FAILED. This target empties the frontend log buckets first to
# shrink that window, then destroys; if a straggler log still lands while the
# CloudFront distribution is deleting (which takes minutes), it empties once more
# and retries. After destroy, straggler CloudWatch log groups (re-created by
# late async log delivery — see _delete-straggler-log-groups) are swept.
# Re-running the whole target is always safe — every step is idempotent.
# The retry block invokes make via the shell's $$MAKE (exported by make into

#
# COOLDOWN_DAYS gates `make upgrade` against PyPI versions uploaded in the last
# N days. This is the local mirror of the Dependabot cooldown — it defends
# laptop-side dependency upgrades against fresh malicious releases (xz-utils /
# nx / tj-actions class incidents). The cooldown only applies to `upgrade`,
# not `lock`: `lock` reproduces decisions already encoded in pyproject.toml
# and the existing uv.lock, while `upgrade` is where brand-new versions
# enter the project and is the only place a fresh malicious release can land.
#
# Override at the command line: `make upgrade COOLDOWN_DAYS=14`.
COOLDOWN_DAYS ?= 7
# Lazy ('=' not ':=') so the python3 subshell only runs when the recipe that
# expands $(COOLDOWN_CUTOFF) actually fires. Otherwise every `make help` /
# `make test` invocation pays the python startup cost up-front.
# Bare `python3` (not `uv run python`) is intentional: this is a stdlib-only date
# calc, system python3 is already a documented prerequisite, and avoiding `uv run`
# preserves the lazy-eval startup savings above. python3's datetime is also more
# portable than shelling out to `date`, whose flags differ between macOS (-v) and
# GNU/Linux (-d) — this repo is developed on both.
COOLDOWN_CUTOFF = $(shell python3 -c 'from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone; print((datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=$(COOLDOWN_DAYS))).strftime("%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z"))')

	# pre-commit hook revs and the npm-side pins (CDK CLI, markdownlint) ride
	# along so one command refreshes every dependency surface. NOTE: neither
	# pre-commit autoupdate nor npm honours the PyPI cooldown above — those
	# bumps land at whatever upstream just released. Dependabot's cooldown
	# still applies to its own PRs; for a cooldown-conscious local refresh,
	# review these two diffs (release dates) before committing.

# Wrapper around scripts/deps_merge.sh — see the file header for the full

# regenerates uv.lock, and concurrent processing would have later PRs clobber
# earlier ones during squash-merge.

clean: ## Remove build artifacts, caches, and coverage files (preserves venvs)

	# suffixed files pytest-cov leaves behind when parallel runs race on the name.

	find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +

# Separate from `clean` because re-installing both venvs takes minutes (CDK
# bundle, all groups) and is not something you want in a routine cache reset.
# When you DO need a fresh install (lockfile changes that uv refuses to
# reconcile, corrupted venv, switching Python versions), run this then
# `make install`.
clean-venvs: ## Wipe .venv and .venv-lambda (separate from `clean` which preserves them)
	rm -rf .venv .venv-lambda
	@echo "Venvs removed. Run 'make install' to recreate."
