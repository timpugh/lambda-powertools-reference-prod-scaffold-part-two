# CDK and Lambda Powertools require incompatible `attrs` versions (CDK pulls
# attrs<26 via jsii; Powertools pulls attrs>=26). uv locks both resolutions
# in a single uv.lock via `[tool.uv.conflicts]`, but each resolution must
# install into its own venv.
#
# Both venvs live at the PROJECT ROOT (relative paths, gitignored):
#
#   .venv         — CDK workstation: cdk + test + lint + docs groups
#   .venv-lambda  — Lambda runtime:  lambda + test + lint groups (unit tests, OpenAPI gen)
#
# Both are created automatically by `make install` (which runs `uv sync` for
# each group set into the right env). You do not pick the location — uv does,
# based on the directory `make` is invoked from. Each clone of this repo gets
# its own pair; nothing is shared across projects on disk.
#
# Check status with `make doctor`. Nuke and rebuild with `make clean-venvs &&
# make install`.
#
# The venv selector uses the UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT env var that uv honours
# natively — no activation dance, no symlink juggling.

LAMBDA_RUN := $(LAMBDA_ENV) uv run

# CDK CLI comes from package.json via npx (installed by `npm ci` in `make
# install`), not a global `npm install -g`. The global route left the CLI as
# the one un-pinned supply-chain input in an otherwise fully-locked repo, and
# let local and CI versions drift apart. Dependabot's npm ecosystem tracks the
# pin in package.json like every Python dependency.

# up/tear down a namespaced, collision-free copy of all five stacks — e.g.

# a shared account. Non-prod environments keep dashboards and alarms but skip
# the SNS alarm topic so an ephemeral stack never pages anyone. See app.py.

	# --timeout=120 lifts the 30s per-test cap from pyproject (an ini option,

# Combined coverage across BOTH venvs in one report. The editor's Test panel
# can't produce a single cross-venv number on its own — each "Run with
# Coverage" loads one .coverage data file, and the multi-root global run's
# per-folder line highlighting is subject to an upstream bug
# (microsoft/vscode-python#25643). This target sidesteps both: it runs the CDK
# suite under .venv and the unit suite under .venv-lambda, each appending into
# ONE shared .coverage (--cov-append, no erase between runs), then renders a
# single HTML report spanning infrastructure/ (covered by the CDK tests) and
# lambda/ (covered by the unit tests). --override-ini=addopts= drops the global
# unit-only flags (--cov=lambda, the 100% gate, -n auto) so this run sets its
# own --cov targets and is NOT gated — the combined total is informational
# (infrastructure/ carries intentional uncovered defensive lines), while the 100%
# lambda/ gate stays enforced by `make test` and CI. Integration tests are
# excluded: they need a live stack. coverage is invoked via `python -m` so it
# resolves from each venv's pytest-cov install without relying on a console
# script on PATH.
# Two validation-aspect tests read a *populated* error annotation
# (Annotations.find_error returning a hit). That trips a known jsii bug, but ONLY
# under coverage instrumentation: MetadataEntry is a struct the kernel can return
# by-reference, and jsii's interface registry then can't resolve it
# (KeyError: aws-cdk-lib.cloud_assembly_schema.MetadataEntry). Under --cov it is
# effectively deterministic (all retry attempts failed identically), so those two
# tests are DESELECTED from the coverage run only. They still run — and gate
# correctness — in the cdk-check CI job, which runs the full tests/cdk suite
# without --cov and never hits the bug. Full write-up: README "Design decisions
# and known limitations". The tradeoff is a negligible dip in the informational
# badge (the aspect's error-emitting branch isn't exercised under --cov); that
# branch is still run by cdk-check's full no-coverage suite.

	# and asset bundling silently doesn't run on them.
	#
	# The explicit report check is the cdk-nag v3 hard gate: CDK signals a
	# failed policy validation by setting process.exitCode in the NODE process,
	# which for a Python app is jsii's throwaway kernel — so `cdk synth` exits 0
	# even with findings (verified live; see scripts/check_validation_report.py).
	# The checker fails on any violation AND on a missing report (packs not
	# attached = broken gate, not a pass).

	$(CDK) synth '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG) 2>&1 | grep -i deprecat || echo "No deprecated CDK APIs in use"

cdk-ls: ## List all CDK stacks (uses '**' to descend into Stage-nested stacks)
	# Without '**', `cdk ls` stops at the top-level Stage manifest and
	# prints nothing useful. With it, the five nested stacks (Data, WAF,
	# Backend, Frontend, Audit) are listed — handy as a sanity check after
	# stack-graph refactors or when verifying the Stage wiring is intact.
	$(CDK) ls '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-diff: ## Preview infra changes against deployed stacks (requires AWS credentials)
	# Same Stage-nesting trap as cdk-synth and deploy: bare `cdk diff`
	# walks only the App's direct children and reports no changes for the
	# five real stacks. Use this as the pre-PR companion to cdk-synth —
	# synth tells you cdk-nag is happy, diff tells you what would deploy.

cdk-drift: ## Detect drift between deployed resources and what CDK last shipped (requires AWS credentials)
	# Surfaces resources mutated outside CDK — console edits, manual SDK
	# calls, neighbor-stack collisions. Load-bearing for this template's
	# encryption posture: CMK key policies, IAM grants, and CloudTrail
	# trail config are easy to silently drift and easy to miss.

cdk-revert-drift: ## Deploy AND auto-revert out-of-band drift back to code (requires CDK CLI 2.1110.0+)
	# The remediation half of cdk-drift: where `cdk drift` only reports
	# resources mutated outside CDK, --revert-drift rolls them back to what
	# the code last shipped — in the same operation as any pending template
	# changes (CloudFormation's REVERT_DRIFT deployment mode). Self-healing
	# posture for this template's encryption invariants: a console-edited CMK
	# key policy or IAM grant snaps back to the committed state on deploy.
	#
	# Deliberately a separate, opt-in target rather than folded into `deploy`:
	# --revert-drift assumes code is always the source of truth, so it would
	# also undo a legitimate emergency console change made during an incident.
	# Keep the default `deploy` predictable; reach for this consciously after
	# `make cdk-drift` shows what would be reverted.

cdk-diagnose: ## Root-cause CloudFormation failures with construct paths and source locations (CDK 2.1120.0+)
	# The --unstable=diagnose flag gates the command while it's behind the
	# unstable feature flag; drop the flag once it graduates to stable.
	# Output maps CFN errors back to the construct and the file:line where
	# it was defined — designed to be parseable by AI agents as well as
	# humans. Substitute a specific stack name for '**' to narrow scope.
	$(CDK) --unstable=diagnose diagnose '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

cdk-gc: ## Inspect (dry-run) unused Lambda/Docker assets in the CDK bootstrap S3/ECR repos
	# Every `cdk deploy` adds new Lambda zips and container images to the
	# CDKToolkit bootstrap bucket and ECR repo, but older revisions
	# accumulate forever. --action=print is dry-run only — it tags isolated
	# assets and reports what *would* be deleted on a subsequent run, but
	# deletes nothing. To actually GC, run `npx cdk --unstable=gc gc` directly:
	# the default (--action=full, --confirm=true) prompts interactively
	# before each deletion. --created-buffer-days=1 (default) skips assets
	# younger than a day; tune via --created-buffer-days=N for tighter
	# windows. The --unstable=gc flag gates the command while gc is behind
	# the unstable feature flag; drop it once gc graduates to stable.
	$(CDK) --unstable=gc gc --action=print

cdk-rollback: ## Roll deployed stacks back to their last stable state (use after a partial deploy failure)
	# Pairs with cdk-diagnose: when a deploy half-fails and CloudFormation
	# parks a stack in UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED, this returns it to the
	# last good state without manual console intervention. Same '**' trap
	# as cdk-synth and friends — bare `cdk rollback` only sees the empty
	# Stage manifest.
	$(CDK) rollback '**' $(CDK_ENV_ARG)

# The '**' glob is required so CDK descends into the Stage-nested stacks —
# without it `cdk deploy` only sees the empty Stage manifest and exits with
# "No stack found in the main cloud assembly". --require-approval never
# skips the interactive IAM-change prompt; cdk-nag has already gated the
# change at synth time. Drop the flag for a manual review of every IAM diff.
deploy: ## Deploy all stacks to us-east-1 (ENV=<name> for an ephemeral env, -c region=X for other regions)

# Enable the opt-in AppConfig gradual rollout + alarm rollback monitor
# (-c appconfig_monitor=true). This is deliberately a SECOND-deploy operation:
# the monitor cannot create a cold stack — a fresh alarm starts INSUFFICIENT_DATA,
# which AppConfig treats as a rollback signal, so it aborts the first deploy (see
# README "Deployment safety"). The guard below queries CloudFormation and refuses
# unless the backend stack already exists in an updatable *_COMPLETE state, so
# this target can never BE the cold deploy. To turn the monitor back off, run a
# plain `make deploy` (reverts to all-at-once and removes the monitor).

# RESUME-SAFETY: _snapshot-log-groups (below) MERGES its fresh CFN query into

# across a failed-then-retried `make destroy-clean` on the SAME deployment: a
# partial teardown attempt can have already destroyed one or more stacks, and
# a later attempt's fresh query can no longer see those stacks at all — so
# truncating on the re-run would silently drop the names it captured while
# they still existed. Live-proven 2026-07-10: `make destroy-clean ENV=verify2`
# deleted the Audit stack in attempt 1, then failed later on a frontend
# bucket straggler; the re-run's (then-truncating) snapshot query no longer
# saw the Audit stack, losing its log group names — including the S3
# auto-delete provider group, whose physical name CloudFormation truncates
# the ENV portion of ("verify", not "verify2"), so it escaped both the
# exact-name sweep (name no longer in the snapshot) and the env-prefixed
# sweep (prefix cut short). One log group survived the teardown and had to
# be deleted by hand.

# above closeable: prefixes can't reconstruct a mid-word-truncated function name,
# but CloudFormation knows each group's exact physical ID while the stack
# still exists. Missing stacks contribute nothing (fresh teardown re-runs are
# no-ops). The WAF stack is queried in us-east-1 (it always lives there).
#
# MERGES rather than truncates: the fresh query lands in a scratch file, then
# gets combined with any pre-existing snapshot (deduped) before being written
# back. This is what makes a re-run after a partial `destroy-clean` failure
# resume-safe — see the RESUME-SAFETY note on LOG_GROUP_SNAPSHOT above for the
# live incident this closes. Carrying forward names from stacks the earlier

# CloudFront / S3 / CloudTrail log delivery is ASYNCHRONOUS, so a log file can land
# in the access-log (or CloudTrail) bucket AFTER cdk's auto_delete_objects empties
# it during teardown — leaving DeleteBucket with a 409 "bucket not empty" and the
# stack in DELETE_FAILED. This target empties the frontend log buckets first to
# shrink that window, then destroys; if a straggler log still lands while the
# CloudFront distribution is deleting (which takes minutes), it retries in a
# BOUNDED LOOP: up to 3 retries (4 destroy attempts total), each preceded by a
# 60s sleep — so the re-empty pass isn't immediately raced by a log written in
# the same second — and a fresh _empty-frontend-buckets pass. A single retry is
# NOT enough: CloudFront standard log delivery can lag up to ~an hour after the
# last request, so on a short-lived environment two stragglers in a row beat one
# retry (live-proven 2026-07-10 — `make destroy-clean ENV=verify2` still hit
# DELETE_FAILED on FrontendAccessLogBucket after the single-retry fallback, on a
# log delivered at 22:55:25, after the one empty-and-retry pass had already run).
# After destroy succeeds (or all attempts are exhausted), straggler CloudWatch
# log groups (re-created by late async log delivery — see
# _delete-straggler-log-groups) are swept. Re-running the whole target is always
# safe — every step, and the loop itself, is idempotent.
# The retry loop invokes make via the shell's $$MAKE (exported by make into
# every recipe environment), NOT the literal $(MAKE) variable reference. The
# distinction is load-bearing: make executes any recipe line containing
# $(MAKE)/$ {MAKE} even under -n, so with the literal form a "dry-run"
# `make -n destroy-clean` would have REALLY run `cdk destroy` against the
# live stacks (observed; the recipe line is one shell command, so the destroy
# rides along with the recursive call). $$MAKE escapes make's recursive-line
# scan, making -n print this line instead of executing it — this holds for
# every $$MAKE call inside the retry loop below, not just a single fallback.
