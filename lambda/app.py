"""Serverless App Lambda handler — the handler layer.

This module initializes the AWS Powertools resolver and the AWS provider clients
(SSM, AppConfig feature flags, the DynamoDB idempotency layer) with a shared
retry config, validates the environment at cold start, routes the API Gateway
event, and translates the service layer's domain errors into HTTP responses. The
business logic lives in :mod:`service` and the data contracts in :mod:`models`,
so this file stays focused on wiring and the HTTP boundary.

It demonstrates the Powertools utilities a production handler leans on:
structured logging, X-Ray tracing, CloudWatch metrics, idempotency, SSM
parameters, feature flags, Pydantic-backed request/response validation (with an
OpenAPI spec generated at documentation-build time — see
scripts/generate_openapi.py), and Event Source Data Classes.

# Shared botocore retry config applied to every AWS SDK client this handler uses
# (SSM, AppConfig, DynamoDB). botocore retries transient failures by default, but
# pinning the policy here makes the posture explicit and tunable rather than
# implicit in the SDK default — the same "visible in code, not implicit in the
# runtime default" rationale behind setting recursive_loop="Terminate" on the
# function in CDK. "adaptive" mode adds client-side rate limiting on top of
# exponential backoff with jitter, which backs off proactively when a dependency
# starts returning throttling (429) responses; its token-bucket state is useful
# here because the clients are module-scoped (constructed once below) and reused
# across every warm invocation, so the limiter persists for the container's life.
# max_attempts=4 is the TOTAL attempt budget in standard/adaptive modes (1 initial
# request + up to 3 retries; only legacy mode counts retries-after-initial) —
# comfortably inside the function's 10s timeout. Retrying is
# safe because the write path (DynamoDB via @idempotent) is idempotent on the
# client-supplied Idempotency-Key, and the SSM/AppConfig calls are reads. This
# implements the AWS "retry with backoff" prescriptive-guidance pattern without
# hand-rolling a retry loop — see README "Patterns deliberately not used".
# connect/read timeouts bound each ATTEMPT: the retry budget above only helps
# against fast-fail errors — botocore's defaults are 60s connect + 60s read,
# six times the function's own 10s timeout, so a single hung connection would
# otherwise consume the whole invocation (502 to the caller) before the first
# retry ever fired. Bounding the attempt turns a hang into a fast, retryable
# error; 1s/2s is generous for the small same-region SSM/AppConfig/DynamoDB
# calls this handler makes.

# BadRequest — making the requirement enforced rather than implicit. Keying on a
# client-controlled value (instead of the server-generated

    Caching caveat: @idempotent wraps the whole resolver, and Powertools persists
