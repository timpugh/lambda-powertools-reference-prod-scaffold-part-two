"""Hello World Lambda function using AWS Lambda Powertools.

This module implements a serverless API endpoint that returns a greeting message.
It demonstrates the use of Powertools utilities including structured logging,
X-Ray tracing, CloudWatch metrics, idempotency, SSM parameters, feature flags,
Pydantic-backed request/response validation (with an OpenAPI spec generated
at documentation-build time — see scripts/generate_openapi.py), and Event Source
Data Classes.

# pinning the policy here makes the posture explicit and tunable rather than
# implicit in the SDK default — the same "visible in code, not implicit in the
# runtime default" rationale behind setting recursive_loop="Terminate" on the
# function in CDK. "adaptive" mode adds client-side rate limiting on top of
# exponential backoff with jitter, which backs off proactively when a dependency
# starts returning throttling (429) responses; its token-bucket state is useful
# here because the clients are module-scoped (constructed once below) and reused
# across every warm invocation, so the limiter persists for the container's life.
# max_attempts=4 is the TOTAL attempt budget in standard/adaptive modes (1 initial
# request + up to 3 retries; only legacy mode counts retries-after-initial) —
# comfortably inside the function's 10s timeout. Retrying is
# safe because the write path (DynamoDB via @idempotent) is idempotent on the
# client-supplied Idempotency-Key, and the SSM/AppConfig calls are reads. This

# lambda_handler lowercases all header keys before the @idempotent layer sees
# the event — the JMESPath then only needs the single lowercase form instead of
# enumerating casings. raise_on_no_idempotency_key turns a missing header into
# Powertools' IdempotencyKeyError, which the resolver below converts into a 400
# BadRequest — making the requirement enforced rather than implicit. Keying on a
# client-controlled value (instead of the server-generated
# requestContext.requestId, which changes on every retry) is what actually makes

    Caching caveat: @idempotent wraps the whole resolver, and Powertools persists
    whatever this function *returns* (only raised exceptions are not cached). The
    APIGatewayRestResolver returns non-2xx outcomes — 404 (unknown route), 422
    (validation), and the 500 produced when ``hello`` raises InternalServerError —
    as response dicts rather than exceptions, so those are cached under the
    client's Idempotency-Key for ``expires_after_seconds`` (1 hour). A client that
    reuses the same key after fixing the route/payload would get the stale error
    replayed. This is acceptable for this single-GET reference (the documented
    contract is one key per logical request — see README "Idempotency keys"); a
    fork that wants transient errors retried under the same key should move
    idempotency onto ``hello`` (the success-bearing function) instead of the
    resolver — Powertools supports this directly via
    ``@idempotent_function(data_keyword_argument=..., ...)`` with a
    ``PydanticSerializer`` output serializer, so the cached record stores the
