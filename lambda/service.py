"""Service layer — business logic for the greeting API.

Holds the domain logic (fetch the configured greeting from SSM, apply the
``enhanced_greeting`` feature flag, compose the message), separate from the
handler so it is unit-testable on its own and could be shared by a second
handler. The handler (``app.py``) owns the I/O wiring — the Powertools resolver,
the AWS provider clients, and their shared retry config — and passes the
providers it constructs into :func:`build_greeting`, so this layer carries no
module-level AWS client state.

``logger`` and ``metrics`` are instantiated here too: Powertools' utilities are
designed to be created per-module (instances share the same underlying logger by
service name and the same metric buffer), so each layer declares the
observability it uses rather than importing it across the layer boundary.
