"""CDK application entry point.

Synthesizes a :class:`HelloWorldStage` per target region and deployment
environment. Each Stage groups the three stacks that make up one regional
deployment (WAF, backend, frontend) so ``cdk deploy`` treats them as a
single unit:

  HelloWorldWaf-{region}      — WAF WebACL, physically in us-east-1
                                (CloudFront constraint), but named per region
                                so each Stage is fully independent and can
                                be destroyed separately.
  HelloWorld-{region}         — Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SSM, AppConfig
  HelloWorldFrontend-{region} — S3, CloudFront (references WAF ARN cross-region
                                via SSM when target region differs from us-east-1)

The target region is controlled by the ``region`` CDK context key.
Defaults to us-east-1 if not specified.

The deployment environment is controlled by the ``env`` CDK context key,
falling back to the ``ENVIRONMENT`` variable, defaulting to ``prod``.
``prod`` keeps the un-suffixed stack names above (so the long-lived
deployment is unaffected) and routes alarms to the SNS topic. Any other
value namespaces every stack (``HelloWorld-{env}-{region}``), which makes
ephemeral per-developer or per-branch deployments collision-free in a
shared account, and disables alarm paging for them.

Usage:
    cdk deploy --all                            # prod stage in us-east-1 (default)
    cdk deploy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1   # separate Singapore Stage
    cdk deploy --all -c env=alice-feature-x     # ephemeral developer stage
    make deploy ENV=alice-feature-x             # same, via the Makefile

Each Stage is fully independent — destroying one does not affect any other.
All three stacks for a given region+environment are destroyed together:

    cdk destroy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1
    cdk destroy --all -c env=alice-feature-x
