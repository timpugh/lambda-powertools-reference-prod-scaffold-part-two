"""CDK application entry point.

Synthesizes a :class:`AppStage` per target region and deployment
environment. Each Stage groups the five stacks that make up one regional
deployment (data, WAF, backend, frontend, audit) so ``cdk deploy`` treats them
as a single unit:

  ServerlessAppWaf-{region}      — WAF WebACL, physically in us-east-1
                                (CloudFront constraint), but named per region
                                so each Stage is fully independent and can
                                be destroyed separately.
  ServerlessAppData-{region}     — stateful layer: DynamoDB idempotency table and
                                its dedicated CMK, isolated so its lifecycle is
                                independent of the stateless compute stack
                                (RETAIN/protection togglable via retain_data).
  ServerlessAppBackend-{region}         — Lambda, API Gateway, SSM, AppConfig
  ServerlessAppFrontend-{region} — S3, CloudFront (references WAF ARN cross-region
                                via SSM when target region differs from us-east-1)
  ServerlessAppAudit-{region}    — stateful audit layer: the CloudTrail object-level
                                S3 data-event trail, its log bucket, and a
                                dedicated CMK. Audits the frontend buckets
                                one-way (RETAIN/protection togglable via
                                retain_data).

The target region is controlled by the ``region`` CDK context key.
Defaults to us-east-1 if not specified.

The stateful stacks' retention posture is controlled by the ``retain_data`` CDK
context key (``-c retain_data=true``). It defaults to ``false`` so the template
tears down cleanly; production forks set it true to flip the data and audit
stacks (tables, buckets, CMKs) to RETAIN with deletion/termination protection.

The AppConfig feature-flag rollout posture is controlled by the
``appconfig_monitor`` CDK context key (``-c appconfig_monitor=true``). It defaults
to ``false`` (all-at-once flag deployment, no monitor) so the cold/first deploy
always succeeds; enable it only after a first deploy to get a gradual rollout with
alarm-driven auto-rollback for ongoing flag changes (see README "Deployment safety").

The greeting SSM parameter's name is optionally overridden by the
``ssm_param_path`` CDK context key (``-c ssm_param_path=/org/app/greeting``). It
defaults to ``None``, which keeps CDK's auto-generated name (the Lambda reads
whichever name is live via the ``GREETING_PARAM_NAME`` env var either way).
**Caution:** set it before the first deploy, or accept parameter replacement —
changing ``parameter_name`` on a deployed stack replaces the parameter and
resets its value to "hello world".

The deployment environment is controlled by the ``env`` CDK context key,
falling back to the ``ENVIRONMENT`` variable, defaulting to ``prod``.
``prod`` keeps the un-suffixed stack names above (so the long-lived
deployment is unaffected) and routes alarms to the SNS topic. Any other
value namespaces every stack (``ServerlessAppBackend-{env}-{region}``), which makes
ephemeral per-developer or per-branch deployments collision-free in a
shared account, and disables alarm paging for them.

The ``pipeline`` CDK context key (``-c pipeline=true``) switches this file to
synthesize :class:`PipelineStack`, the self-mutating CD pipeline, instead of a
directly-deployable :class:`AppStage`. It defaults to ``false``, keeping
``make deploy`` and ephemeral ``env`` deploys on the legacy direct-Stage
shape. Pipeline mode requires the CodeConnections connection ARN (from the
one-time console handshake — see
``infrastructure.app_stage.validate_code_connection_arn``), resolved from the
``code_connection_arn`` context key or, failing that, the
``CODE_CONNECTION_ARN`` environment variable. The ARN is deliberately NOT
committed (it embeds the account id; the repo is public): ``make
deploy-pipeline`` auto-discovers it from the account for the workstation
birth deploy, and the pipeline's own synth step reads it from an env var
baked into its CodeBuild definition (see ``pipeline_stack.py``). Pipeline
mode also rejects any ``env`` context value outright: the pipeline owns its
own ``dev`` and ``prod`` environments end to end, so an ``-c env`` override
would silently do nothing.

Usage:
    cdk deploy --all                            # prod stage in us-east-1 (default)
    cdk deploy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1   # separate Singapore Stage
    cdk deploy --all -c env=alice-feature-x     # ephemeral developer stage
    make deploy ENV=alice-feature-x             # same, via the Makefile

Each Stage is fully independent — destroying one does not affect any other.
All five stacks for a given region+environment are destroyed together:

    cdk destroy --all -c region=ap-southeast-1
    cdk destroy --all -c env=alice-feature-x
