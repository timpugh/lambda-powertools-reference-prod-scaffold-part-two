        Implementation notes (these are non-obvious — see README "CloudWatch RUM" section):
        - Each definition needs an explicit ``EventPattern``; the API rejects vended-metric
          submissions with just ``Name`` + ``DimensionKeys`` (returns 200 OK with an Errors[]
          body that AwsCustomResource treats as success).
        - All three ``rum:*`` actions are bundled on the destination CR's policy so the
          BatchCreate call benefits from a full putRumMetricsDestination round-trip of IAM
          propagation lead time. Splitting them per-CR loses the IAM race ~100% of the time.
        - ``on_update`` mirrors ``on_create``; without it AwsCustomResource no-ops on
          CloudFormation UPDATE events and changes to the metric list never reach AWS.
        - Http5xx omits the explicit numeric range filter that Http4xx requires (RUM applies
          the 5xx filter internally for that vended metric).
