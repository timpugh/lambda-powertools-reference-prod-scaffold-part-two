"""HelloWorldStage — groups the WAF, backend, and frontend stacks as one deploy unit.

The three stacks are always deployed together for a given region, so modelling
them as a :class:`cdk.Stage` makes that relationship structural rather than
conventional. A Stage also scopes the synthesised cloud assembly under its
own subdirectory (``cdk.out/assembly-{stage}/``), which keeps multi-region
synths from mixing their templates in the root of ``cdk.out/``.

This change also paves the way for CDK Pipelines (each Stage is the natural
deployment unit) and for a future multi-environment layout (dev/staging/prod
as separate Stage instances under the same App).

Stack names are set explicitly via ``stack_name=`` so the CloudFormation
names stay unchanged (``HelloWorld-{region}`` etc.). Without the override,
wrapping in a Stage would prefix each stack name with the Stage ID, which
would orphan any currently deployed stacks.

Environment dimension
---------------------
``env_name`` adds a deployment-environment axis on top of the region axis.
The default, ``prod``, keeps the legacy stack names byte-for-byte so existing
deployments are not orphaned. Any other value is inserted into every stack
name (``HelloWorld-{env_name}-{region}``), which makes deployments
collision-free per environment — including *ephemeral* per-developer or
per-branch environments (``-c env=alice-feature-x``), where two people
iterating in one account must never fight over the same CloudFormation
stacks. Only the ``prod`` environment routes alarm notifications to the SNS
topic; ephemeral stacks keep dashboards and alarms but page nobody.
