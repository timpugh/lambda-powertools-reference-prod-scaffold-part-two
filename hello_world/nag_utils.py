"""Shared cdk-nag helpers.

``apply_compliance_aspects`` applies the full available rule-pack set to a
stack so every stack exercises the same compliance gauntlet. NIST 800-53 R4
is intentionally omitted — R5 supersedes it and running both would duplicate
findings on overlapping controls.

``CDK_LAMBDA_SUPPRESSIONS`` is the canonical suppression list for CDK-managed
singleton Lambdas (AwsCustomResource provider, BucketDeployment, S3AutoDeleteObjects).
Their runtime, memory, tracing, DLQ, VPC, and IAM policies are all managed by
CDK and cannot be configured by the caller. Import it and pass it to
``NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions_by_path`` or
``NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions`` with ``apply_to_children=True``.

    AwsCustomResource provider Lambdas are invoked asynchronously by

    async retries is silently dropped — the stack rollback still surfaces
    a CFN error, but the *cause* (Python traceback, AWS API error response)
    is gone unless someone catches it in CloudWatch within the retention
    window. SQS as the on_failure destination preserves the failed-event
    envelope (full request payload + responseContext) for post-mortem.

    retention (Lambda's max meaningful window — events older than that
    have already aged past most rollback investigations).
