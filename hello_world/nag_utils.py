"""Shared cdk-nag helpers.

``apply_compliance_aspects`` applies the full available rule-pack set to a
stack so every stack exercises the same compliance gauntlet. NIST 800-53 R4
is intentionally omitted — R5 supersedes it and running both would duplicate
findings on overlapping controls.

``CDK_LAMBDA_SUPPRESSIONS`` is the canonical suppression list for CDK-managed
singleton Lambdas (AwsCustomResource provider, BucketDeployment, S3AutoDeleteObjects).
Their runtime, memory, tracing, DLQ, VPC, and IAM policies are all managed by
CDK and cannot be configured by the caller. Import it and pass it to
``NagSuppressions.add_resource_suppressions`` with ``apply_to_children=True``,
or use the ``suppress_cdk_singletons`` helper. Absolute-path suppression
(``add_resource_suppressions_by_path``) is intentionally avoided throughout this
project: the singletons are resolved via ``node.try_find_child`` so suppressions
keep working when the stacks are nested under a ``cdk.Stage`` (a path string
would break on the added Stage prefix).
