## Project

Reference architecture for serverless AWS Lambda + Powertools applications: five-stack CDK composition (two stateful stacks — data and audit — plus WAF, backend, and frontend), five-rule-pack cdk-nag gating, end-to-end CMK encryption, WAF + CloudFront, CloudTrail data events, browser RUM with X-Ray correlation, Athena access-log analytics, and supply-chain hygiene. Designed to be forked via GitHub's "Use this template" — see the "Forking this template" section at the bottom.

## Environments — two venvs, never mix

CDK and Powertools require incompatible `attrs` versions (CDK pulls `attrs<26` via jsii; Powertools pulls `attrs>=26`). `[tool.uv.conflicts]` in `pyproject.toml` lets one `uv.lock` hold both resolutions, installed into separate venvs:

- `.venv` — CDK workstation. Used for `cdk synth`, `cdk deploy`, stack-assertion tests, lint/format/typecheck of `infrastructure/`.
- `.venv-lambda` — Lambda runtime. Used for unit tests over `lambda/`, integration tests, the OpenAPI generator script.

`make install` provisions both venvs, runs `npm ci` (the CDK CLI and markdownlint are pinned in `package.json` and invoked via `npx` — never `npm install -g`), and wires pre-commit. Never install Powertools into `.venv` or CDK into `.venv-lambda`. One deliberate exception: plain `pydantic` is pinned in the `lint` group (so it lands in BOTH venvs) purely so mypy's `pydantic.mypy` plugin loads on each side — it has no `attrs` dependency, so it doesn't touch the conflict.

Run `make doctor` after `make install` to verify both venvs picked up the expected groups, `npx cdk`/`drawio` resolve, and pre-commit is wired. `make clean-venvs && make install` is the recovery path for a corrupted venv. `make pr` runs every CI gate locally in CI's order.

## `cdk synth` must use `'**'`

All five stacks live inside `AppStage` (a `cdk.Stage`). Bare `cdk synth` walks only the App's direct children, finds the Stage, doesn't recurse, and emits an empty synthesis that succeeds *without* running cdk-nag against the real stacks. `make cdk-synth` and the CI `cdk-check` job both invoke `cdk synth '**'`. If you run `cdk synth` directly during development, include the glob — otherwise the gate passes silently regardless of what cdk-nag would find.

## cdk-nag is a hard gate

Five rule packs run on every synth: AwsSolutions, Serverless, NIST 800-53 R5, HIPAA Security, PCI DSS 3.2.1. Findings fail CI. Resolve by:

1. **Fix the underlying issue** (preferred). README "Design decisions and known limitations" documents recurring patterns.
2. **Suppress with rationale**. Every suppression carries a `reason=` string. For `AwsSolutions-IAM5` wildcards, scope with `applies_to=["Resource::*"]` or a specific pattern and explain *why* the wildcard is unavoidable.

A bespoke validation Aspect rides alongside the packs (also wired by `apply_compliance_aspects`): `TemplateConventionChecks` in `infrastructure/validation_aspects.py` enforces two project conventions no rule pack covers — every log group declares an explicit retention (never-expire is the CloudWatch default), and every stateful resource (`CfnBucket`, DynamoDB `CfnTable`/`CfnGlobalTable`, `CfnKey`) declares an explicit removal policy. Its violations are error-level annotations, so they fail the same gates as nag findings (and `TestNagCompliance`); it's unit-tested in `tests/cdk/test_validation_aspects.py`.

**Local nag gate**: `Template.from_stack()` does **NOT** raise on cdk-nag (or validation-Aspect) errors, but they surface as error-level annotations — and `tests/cdk/test_stage.py::TestNagCompliance` asserts that list is empty for every stack (prod and ephemeral shapes). So `make test-cdk` catches unsuppressed findings locally, without Docker. The CLI `cdk synth '**'` in the CI `cdk-check` job remains the authoritative gate (it also exercises asset bundling); run `make cdk-synth` with Docker started for the full CI-equivalent check before pushing IAM-touching code.

## Encryption posture

Every data-bearing resource that supports a per-resource customer-managed key is CMK-encrypted: DynamoDB, Lambda env vars, all log groups, the frontend S3 bucket, AppConfig hosted configuration content, SQS DLQs, and CloudTrail trail log files (per-object SSE-KMS into an SSE-S3 bucket). Keys are scoped per stack rather than shared — the WAF, backend, and frontend stacks each own one CMK; the **DynamoDB table is encrypted by its own dedicated CMK in `DataStack`**; and the **CloudTrail audit logs by their own dedicated CMK in `AuditStack`** (keeping the key with the stateful data it protects is what makes the `retain_data` switch meaningful — retained data whose key lived in a destroyable compute stack would be unreadable after teardown; see those modules' docstrings). Keys are deliberately *not* shared across the stack boundary, so each carries a tighter, least-privilege key policy. Account/region-wide encryption settings (X-Ray, Glue Data Catalog) are deliberately out of scope — they'd mutate state shared with other apps in the account.

Service-principal grants on CMKs must be confused-deputy-guarded with `aws:SourceAccount` + `aws:SourceArn`. See `grant_logs_service_to_key` / `grant_cloudtrail_service_to_key` in `infrastructure/nag_utils.py` for the canonical pattern. **Caveat learned live:** a service-principal key statement only matches calls a service makes *as itself* — it never matches calls made through the service's assumed service-linked role (a GuardDuty-SLR grant of this form was live-proven dead policy and removed; see README "GuardDuty … deliberately have NO kms:Decrypt"). One documented exception: `grant_cloudwatch_alarms_to_key` (alarm→SNS publish path) uses `aws:SourceAccount` + `kms:ViaService` and deliberately omits `aws:SourceArn` — CloudWatch is not documented to set it on via-SNS KMS calls, and an unmatched required condition would silently drop alarm notifications. Verify alarm delivery on a live deploy when touching that statement.

## Stateful resources live in their own stack (`retain_data`)

The stateful data layer (the DynamoDB idempotency table + its dedicated CMK) lives in `infrastructure/data_stack.py`, separate from the stateless compute/backend stack — the CDK best practice "keep stateful resources in their own stack." This is baked in deliberately as production-template preparation: **stack topology is the expensive-to-retrofit decision; `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN` is a one-line flag.** So the *structure* ships now, and a production fork flips exactly one switch — `retain_data` (CDK context `-c retain_data=true`, plumbed `app.py` → `AppStage` → `DataStack`). `retain_data=True` flips the table and its CMK to `RETAIN`, turns on DynamoDB deletion protection, and enables stack termination protection. The default is `False` so the template and ephemeral environments tear down cleanly. The table is handed to the backend cross-stack (`idempotency_table=`), where the Lambda gets its `IDEMPOTENCY_TABLE_NAME` env var, a scoped read/write grant, and monitoring — the single cross-stack relationship. The `DynamoDBInBackupPlan` nag suppressions live on the data stack (it owns the table); a `retain_data=True` fork should add an AWS Backup plan (see `TODO.md`). The `IdempotencyTableName` CfnOutput moved to the data stack too.

**Don't treat the separation as inviolable.** It's a deliberate trade-off, not a settled truth — the opposing "high cohesion" view (stateful + stateless in one stack: atomic deploys, no cross-stack export coupling) is legitimate. Two things to keep honest: (1) the split itself does **not** protect data — `RETAIN` + deletion/termination protection do, and those ride `retain_data` regardless of topology (default `False` = the data stack is fully destroyable); (2) the cost of the split is the cross-stack export on the table — a replacement-forcing change can need a two-step deploy (CloudFormation won't drop an in-use export). The template still separates on purpose (expensive-to-retrofit topology, CMK-with-data, blast-radius isolation, and to model the production-shaped layout a fork grows into), but folding the data/audit stacks back into compute — keeping `retain_data` — is a valid simplification for a small single-service fork, not a regression. Full write-up in README "Stateful data stack and `retain_data`".

## Audit data lives in its own stack too (`AuditStack`)

The second stateful stack, `infrastructure/audit_stack.py`, holds the compliance-relevant audit data — the **CloudTrail object-level S3 data-event trail, its log bucket, and a dedicated CMK** — separate from the stateless frontend that *produces* the events. Same `retain_data` switch (RETAIN + termination protection in prod; DESTROY + auto-delete by default), same dedicated-CMK rationale (retaining audit logs must retain the audit key, not the frontend key that also encrypts the destroy-friendly asset bucket). The trail's log bucket has a 90-day S3 lifecycle.

**The trail + its bucket are inseparable** (the bucket policy references the trail ARN), so both live here together; the buckets the trail merely **audits** (the frontend asset + access-log buckets) stay in the frontend stack and are passed in via `audited_buckets=`. That makes the dependency **one-way: audit → frontend** (the frontend never references the audit stack), which is the only cycle-free boundary that doesn't require pinning bucket names. **Do not** move the access-log bucket into the audit stack or the trail into the frontend stack — either reintroduces a dependency cycle (the access-log bucket is written by CloudFront in the frontend; the trail audits the frontend asset bucket). The trail name is pinned so the bucket-policy confused-deputy Deny can reference its ARN without a cycle (same technique as the RUM monitor).

## Logs go to S3, not CloudWatch (operational vs audit)

Three SSE-S3 log-sink buckets share `nag_utils.create_sse_s3_log_bucket` (block-all, SSL, no versioning, lifecycle expiry, standard log-bucket suppressions): the frontend **access-log** bucket, the **CloudTrail-logs** bucket (audit), and the **WAF-logs** buckets. WAF logs go to S3, not CloudWatch — cheaper long-term retention, queryable via Athena (the frontend stack builds two partition-projected WAF Glue tables — `waf_cloudfront_logs`, `waf_regional_logs` — plus named queries; the Stage computes the WAF log S3 locations and passes them in, avoiding a cross-stack ref). There are **two** WAF log buckets (the WAF→S3 destination must be in the ACL's region): one in `WafStack` (us-east-1, CloudFront WebACL) and one in the backend stack (`_attach_regional_waf`, target region) — both via `create_waf_logs_bucket` (`aws-waf-logs-{account}-{hash}-{suffix}`, AWS forces the `aws-waf-logs-` prefix).

**WAF→S3 bucket-policy gotcha (don't break this):** WAF auto-attaches a `delivery.logs.amazonaws.com` policy when logging is enabled, which collides with a CDK-managed bucket policy (`The bucket policy already exists` — hit on a live deploy). The fix: `create_waf_logs_bucket` *pre-declares* the exact delivery grant, and each caller orders the `CfnLoggingConfiguration` **after** `bucket.policy` (`logging.node.add_dependency(bucket.policy)`) so WAF finds the grant present and leaves the policy alone. Verified on a live deploy: logging config accepted, `cdk diff` shows no drift, clean auto-delete teardown. Keep both the pre-declared grant and the dependency.

Operational CloudWatch retention is 90 days on the app log groups (Lambda, API Gateway); CDK-provider/singleton groups stay at 7. The S3 log buckets default to a 90-day (CloudTrail/WAF) / 7-day (access logs) lifecycle — a compliance fork tiers them to Glacier/Deep Archive and adds Object Lock behind `retain_data` (see README "Audit stack and log retention").

## Deployment safety: canary Lambda (env-gated)

Code deploys get progressive delivery with automatic, alarm-driven rollback in `infrastructure/backend_app.py`, gated by `is_production_env` (canary in prod, fast in dev) — the machinery exists in both shapes, only the rollout speed differs.

- **Code (`_attach_canary_deployment`)**: the function publishes a version, the API integrates with a `live` **alias** (not `$LATEST`), and a `codedeploy.LambdaDeploymentGroup` shifts the alias — `CANARY_10PERCENT_5MINUTES` in prod, `ALL_AT_ONCE` in dev — with `DEPLOYMENT_STOP_ON_ALARM` auto-rollback on a canary alias-errors alarm.

**AppConfig is all-at-once by default; gradual + alarm rollback is opt-in via `-c appconfig_monitor=true`.** The handler always emits a `FeatureFlagEvaluationFailure` EMF metric on the feature-flag fallback path (a bad flag config is caught and returns 200, so it produces no Lambda error — that metric is the only signal a broken config is live). By default the CFN-managed AppConfig deployment is all-at-once and the environment carries **no monitor**. The `appconfig_monitor` context flag (plumbed `app.py` → `AppStage` → `BackendStack` → `BackendApp`, same pattern as `retain_data`) flips the deployment to a gradual strategy (LINEAR 25%/step over 10 min, 5-min bake) and attaches the environment monitor in `_attach_appconfig_rollback_monitor`.

**Why it's off by default and MUST NOT be set on a cold deploy** (proven on a live deploy): an AppConfig deployment monitor rolls back when its alarm is in `ALARM` **or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`** (AWS docs, `monitoring-deployments.html`). A freshly created alarm starts in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` until CloudWatch's first evaluation, and on a cold stack the `FeatureFlagEvaluationFailure` metric has never reported — so AppConfig aborts the very first deployment and the stack can never reach `CREATE_COMPLETE` (happens even with `treat_missing_data=NOT_BREACHING`, which is set). Adoption sequence: deploy once with the default, let the metric report, then `make deploy-appconfig-monitor` (a guarded target that refuses unless the backend stack already exists in an updatable `*_COMPLETE` state, so it can never be the cold deploy; equivalently `-c appconfig_monitor=true`). Persist it across plain deploys by setting `appconfig_monitor: true` in `cdk.json` after the first deploy. The monitor alarm watches a **by-name** metric (`cloudwatch.Metric(namespace="ServerlessApp", metric_name="FeatureFlagEvaluationFailure", ...)`), not `function.metric_errors()` — the environment references the alarm, so the alarm must not transitively reference the Lambda (which depends on the environment via its AppConfig grant), or `Template.from_stack` fails with a dependency cycle that the CLI synth does *not* catch (only the in-process assertion does — `make test-cdk` is the gate). Live-verified end-to-end: enabling the flag after a first deploy flips `enhanced_greeting` and the gradual rollout + monitor work.

Deployment-control alarms carry **no SNS action** (the deployment service polls their state) and suppress `CloudWatchAlarmAction` (NIST/HIPAA) in all environments: the canary alias-errors alarm always, the AppConfig rollback alarm only when `appconfig_monitor=true`. Distinct from the MonitoringFacade operational alarms, which route to SNS in prod. The monitor role's `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` wildcard (IAM5) and inline policy (IAMNoInlinePolicy) suppressions live inside `_attach_appconfig_rollback_monitor`, so they only exist when the flag is on; the monitor-on shape is nag-tested in `tests/cdk/test_stage.py::TestNagCompliance`.

## Dangling-resource cleanup pattern

Services that create supporting resources outside CloudFormation (CloudWatch log groups, dashboards) don't get cleaned up by `cdk destroy`. Two cleanup `AwsCustomResource` patterns ship in this repo:

- `AppInsightsDashboardCleanup` — deletes the auto-created Application Insights dashboard
- `RumLogGroupCleanup` — deletes the auto-created `/aws/vendedlogs/RUMService_*` log group

When adding services that create supporting AWS resources outside CFN, mirror the pattern: Lambda-backed `cr.AwsCustomResource` with an `on_delete` SDK call, IAM scoped to the specific resource ARN, `ignore_error_codes_matching="ResourceNotFoundException"` for the case where the resource never materialized.

## Conventional Commits + git-cliff drive `CHANGELOG.md`

Commit prefix grammar (see README "Commit message convention"):

`feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:` / `refactor:` / `build:`

`cliff.toml` maps these to Keep-a-Changelog groups. Regenerate with `git cliff -o CHANGELOG.md`. Dependabot bumps and `Merge pull request` commits are filtered out by design. The prefix grammar is enforced on PR titles by `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml` (squash-merge subjects feed git-cliff). Release recipe in README "Cutting a release" — driven by `git cliff --bumped-version`, `make lock`, annotated tag; pushing the `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which publishes the GitHub Release from the annotated tag automatically.

## OpenAPI spec is committed and gated

`docs/openapi.json` is generated from `lambda/app.py` (`make openapi`) and **committed**. CI fails on drift (regenerate-and-compare in the `test` job; `make compare-openapi` locally) and on breaking API changes (oasdiff against the base branch's spec, PRs only). After touching routes, Pydantic models, or `responses=` metadata, run `make openapi` and commit the result — otherwise CI rejects the push.

## Deployment environments

Stack names carry an environment dimension: the default `prod` keeps the legacy names (`ServerlessAppBackend-us-east-1` etc. — never rename these; CloudFormation matches by name), while `make deploy ENV=<name>` / `-c env=<name>` deploys a fully namespaced, collision-free copy (ephemeral per-developer/per-branch stacks). Non-prod skips the SNS alarm topic (alarms exist but page nobody) with scoped nag suppressions for the alarm-action rules. Env names are validated at synth (`validate_env_name` in `infrastructure/app_stage.py`). `make destroy-clean ENV=<name>` scopes the bucket-emptying and log-group sweeps to that environment's stack names — the sweeps are deliberately env-prefixed so tearing down one environment can't delete another's log groups. Prefix sweeps alone are insufficient: CloudFormation truncates the *stack-name portion* of Lambda physical names at the 64-char limit (a live teardown left `/aws/lambda/ServerlessAppFrontend-us-eas-…` behind), so `destroy-clean` also snapshots every CFN-owned log group's exact name pre-destroy and deletes re-appearances post-destroy (`_snapshot-log-groups` / `_delete-snapshotted-log-groups`).

## Behaviors to avoid

- **No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer on commits.** Personal preference.
- **Don't introduce account/region-wide CDK constructs** without flagging them explicitly. `glue.CfnDataCatalogEncryptionSettings`, `xray.UpdateEncryptionConfig`, and similar mutate state shared with other apps in the deploying account. Forks dropping this stack into an existing AWS account would silently override neighbor teams' settings.
- **Don't commit `cdk.out/`, `report.html`, `htmlcov/`, `.coverage`, or `site/`.** Reproducible from source; gitignored already.

## Forking this template

When a fork is spawned from this template via GitHub's "Use this template":

1. **Edit this CLAUDE.md's "Project" section** to describe the fork's workload, and add a workload-specific guidance section near the bottom (see [nba-data-api/CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/timpugh/nba-data-api/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for an example).
2. **Run the post-template setup steps**: enable GitHub Pages (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages -X POST -f build_type=workflow` — requires the repo to be public on the free plan), bootstrap CDK in the target account+region (`cdk bootstrap aws://<account>/us-east-1`), and walk through the Production readiness checklist in `TODO.md` before customer traffic.
3. **Don't drift from this template silently.** If you fix something here that other forks would benefit from, push it back upstream. If you change something that diverges intentionally (different encryption posture, different observability stack), document the *why* in your fork's CLAUDE.md so future contributors don't try to reconcile.
